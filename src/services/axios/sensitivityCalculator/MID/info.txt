INFO about the Sensitivity Calculator API and the way it's used in the Sens Cal Front-end
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When clicking on the calculate button in the Sensitivity Calculator, there are 3 API calls made everytime.
1 to the CALCULATE endpoint and 2 to the WEIGHTING endpoint. 

Some results are directly returned from the API, such as the confusion noise. For others, some calculation and combination happens in the front-end,
using the data from the WEIGHTING endpoint and the 'sensitivity' and 'line sensitivity' returned from the CALCULATE endpoint. There is also some conversion
to different units made in the front-end, for example for the confusion noise.

API URLs
--------------
Calculate URL for MID: /ska-ost-senscalc-ui/api/mid/calculate
Weighting URL for MID: /ska-ost-senscalc-ui/api/mid/weighting 

WEIGHTING
----------
The Weighting endpoint has a "calculator_mode parameter". 
This can be set to "continuum" or "line" and will return slightly different results. The format is identic but the values are slightly different.

Continuum Mode
---------------
On Continuum Mode, There is 1 call made to "weighting line mode", and 1 call to weighting continuum mode.

Zoom Mode
----------
On Zoom Mode, There are 2 identic calls made to "weighting line mode", returning the same data.

Mock data
----------
The mock data and query parameters show the results for a request with the default parameters in the Sensitivity Calculator.
