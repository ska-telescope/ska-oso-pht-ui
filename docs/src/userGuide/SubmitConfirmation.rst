Submit Confirmation Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before submitting your proposal, you need to click the "validate" button to check
your proposal against the capability of the telescope for the current cycle. 
If the proposal is valid, you will see a confirmation message at the bottom of the screen. 

If the proposal is not valid then proposal is unable to be submitted as the confirmation button will remain disabled
The details of the validation issues are shown within a modal which lists all of the issues identified.

Review and click 'Confirm' to proceed or 'Cancel' to abandon submission at this time.
