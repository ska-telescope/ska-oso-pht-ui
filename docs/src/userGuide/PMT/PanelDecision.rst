Key Information and Actions
===========================

This section outlines the main features and interactions available on the **Panel Decision** page.

Search Proposals
----------------
Use the search bar at the top of the page to quickly find proposals by their *Title*.

.. tip::
   Partial or case-insensitive matches are supported, making it easy to locate proposals
   even if you remember only part of the title.

View Review and Decision Details
--------------------------------
Click the card for each proposal to expand and view its corresponding reviews
and decision details, as illustrated in :numref:`Figure %s <paneldecison2>`.

Exclude a Review
---------------
Click the |ico1| icon on any review to **exclude** it from the proposal's overall score.
When a review is excluded, the system will automatically:
- Recalculate the **average score** based on remaining active reviews.
- Update the **rank** accordingly.

Understanding Scores and Ranks
------------------------------
- **Score:** The average of all individual review scores (excluding any marked as excluded).  
- **Rank:** Determined by average score such that higher scores yield higher ranks.  
  For example, if one proposal has a score of *5.0* and another *4.5*,  
  the *5.0* will be ranked **1**, and *4.5* will be ranked **2**.

Submit a Recommendation
-----------------------
From the **Recommendation** drop-down list, select one of the following options:
- *Accept*  
- *Reject*  
- *Accept with Revision*

Finalize the Decision
---------------------
Once a recommendation has been selected:
1. Click the |submitico| icon next to the drop-down to **submit** the decision.
2. The proposal's status will automatically update to **Decided**.
3. After submission, **no further updates** can be made to the proposal review.

.. warning::
   Submitting a recommendation is **final**. Ensure your decision is correct
   before clicking the |submitico| icon.
