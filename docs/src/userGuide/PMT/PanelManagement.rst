Panel Management
----------------

This page is accessible only by the Admin of the Proposal Handling Tool (PHT). 


Layout and Navigation
=====================
The layout of the page is presented in :numref:`Figure %s <panelmanagement1>`. 

*  |overviewicon| in the top-left of the page takes you to the :doc:`Overview Page </userGuide/PMT/overview>`. 
*  |assignicon| performs auto-assignment of proposals to the panel.
*  There are search fields that allows you to filter on `Expertize` of the reviewers, `Location` of the reviewers and the `Name` of the reviewers on the `REVIEWERS` tab.
  On the `PROPOSALS/SCIENCE IDEAS` tab, the search fields are on the `type` of proposal/science ideas, `Science Category` and free search on the title of the proposals/science ideas.
*  The default view is the `REVIEWERS` to see all available reviewers and the `PROPOSAL/SCIENCE IDEAS` tab displays all the proposals that are reviewable (submitted and under review).

Key Information and Actions
===========================

This section describes the key functionality available on the **Panel Management** page.

Panel Creation
--------------
Panel creation is **automatic**.  
Currently, only one panel named ``Science Verification`` is created by default.  
It appears on the **left-hand side** of the page, as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <panelmanagement1>`.

.. note::
   Additional panels may be introduced in future cycles.  
   For now, all proposals are associated with the default *Science Verification* panel.

Assignment of Proposals
-----------------------
Click the |assignicon| icon at the **top-right corner** of the page to automatically assign proposals to the active panel.  
The **Admin** can also manually re-assign or remove a proposal from a panel by toggling the check box next to each item.

To view all **reviewable proposals**, select the ``PROPOSALS / SCIENCE IDEAS`` tab  
(see :numref:`Figure %s <panelproposal>`).  
Reviewable proposals or science ideas are those that have been **submitted** or are **currently under review**.


Assignment of Reviewers
-----------------------
When the **Admin** opens this page, the default view lists all available reviewers, both *Science* and *Technical*.  
By selecting or deselecting the check boxes, the Admin can **add** or **remove** reviewers from the active panel.

.. note::
   Notification for reviewers will be implemented in the future.

Creation of Reviews and Decisions
---------------------------------
Once reviewers are assigned to a panel, the corresponding **Review** and **Decision** records for the proposals in that panel are created automatically.  
These records enable reviewers to submit scores and comments, and allow chairs to make final recommendations.

.. tip:: 
- Panel decision is made based on outcome from independent technical and science review.
