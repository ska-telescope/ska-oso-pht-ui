Panel Management
----------------

This page is accessible only by the Admin of the Proposal Handling Tool (PHT). 


Layout and Navigation
=====================
The layout of the page is presented in :numref:`Figure %s <panelmanagement1>`. 

*  |overviewicon| in the top-left of the page takes you to the :doc:`Overview Page </userGuide/PMT/overview>`. 
*  |assignicon| performs auto-assignment of proposals to the panel.
*  There are search fields that allows you to filter on `Expertize` of the reviewers, `Location` of the reviewers and the `Name` of the reviewers on the `REVIEWERS` tab.
  On the `PROPOSALS/SCIENCE IDEAS` tab, the search fields are on the `type` of proposal/science ideas, `Science Category` and free search on the title of the proposals/science ideas.
*  The default view is the `REVIEWERS` to see all available reviewers and the `PROPOSAL/SCIENCE IDEAS` tab displays all the proposals that are reviewable (submitted and under review).


Key Information and Actions
===========================
The functionality of this page includes:

* Panel creation: Panel creation is automatic. Currently, only one panel is created called `Science Verification`. and it appears on the left side of the page (see :numref:`Figure %s <panelmanagement1>`).
* Assignment of proposals: The |assignicon| button on the top-right corner of the page allows the Admin to automatically assign proposals to a panel. However,
  Admin can manually re-assign a proposal or remove a proposal from a panel by unchecking the check-box. Reviewable proposals can be seen by clicking on the `PROPOSALS/SCIENCE IDEAS` tab as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <panelproposal>`.
  Reviewble proposals/science ideas are proposals/science ideas that have been submitted or under review.
* Assignment of Reviewers: Once Admin gets on this page, the default view is a list of available reviewers (both science and technical reviewers). By clicking the check-box, Admin can add or remove reviewers
  to a panel.
* Creation of Reviews: Reviews are auto-created once reviewers are added to the panel.
