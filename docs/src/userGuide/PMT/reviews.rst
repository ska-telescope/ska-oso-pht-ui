Panel Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This page displays reviews assigned assigned based on the signed-in user as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <reviewlanding>`. If the user has no proposals assigned to them then the table on this page will be empty.
Where the reviewers are added to a panel and proposals assigned to that panel, then the user can see those proposals and based on if
they are science or technical reviewers then they can either review the technical feasibility of the proposal, science of the proposal or both.

Key Information and Actions
---------------------------

This section describes the core actions available to a **Science/Technical Reviewer** when performing proposal reviews.

Search and Filter Proposals
---------------------------
Use the **search bar** at the top of the page to quickly locate proposals by *Title*.  
You can also use the **Status** drop-down menu to filter proposals based on their current **Science Review** status.

.. tip::
   Combine both the title search and status filter to narrow down proposals efficiently.

Conflict of Interest Declaration
--------------------------------
When a Science Reviewer clicks the |sciencereviewicon| icon for the **first time**,  
a **Conflict of Interest Declaration** dialog appears, as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <reviewConflict>`.

Select the most appropriate declaration and click **Submit**.  
The available options are:

- *I have no conflict of interest*  
- *I am an investigator on this science idea*  
- *I am a current / recent collaborator of the author(s)*  
- *Other reasons prevent me from rendering a fair and impartial judgement*

.. note::
   You must complete the **Conflict of Interest Declaration** before proceeding to the science review screen.  
   If a conflict is declared, the system will restrict access to the review form for that proposal. For
   technical review, no conflict declaration is needed.

Reviewing a Proposal
--------------------
- If **no conflict** is declared, the proposal science review screen will be accessible fro science reviews, as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <reviewScreen>`.

- The review screen allows you to view key proposal details, enter comments, and assign ranks.
- For technical reviews, the screen is shown in :numref:`Figure %s <techreviewScreen>`

Ranking Proposals and Adding Comments
-------------------------------------
On the **right-hand side** of each proposal in read-only mode:

1. Click the corresponding **rank field** to assign your score for science review or one of *Yes*, *Maybe*, *No* for technical review.
2. Open the **Comments** tab to provide written feedback or justifications.  
3. Choose to either **Save** (to edit later) or **Submit** (to finalise).

.. tip::
   It's recommended to save your draft frequently before final submission,
   especially when entering extended comments.

Submitting a Review
-------------------
Once you are satisfied with your assigned rank and comments, click the **|submiticon| Submit Review** button  
to finalise your review for that proposal.

Upon submission:

- The review status will update to **Reviewed**.  
- The review form becomes **read-only** and can no longer be modified.

.. warning::
   Ensure your comments and ranking are complete before submitting.  
   Once submitted, the review is locked and cannot be re-opened or edited.
