Landing Page
============
On the landing page is a summary table of the proposals associated with you. These will be proposals you have participated in either as a Principal
investigator or as a Co-Investigator. The table in :numref:`Figure %s <figure3>` lists proposals with the following information:

- **Proposal ID** : Unique identifier for each proposal.
- **Proposal Type** : The type of proposal. 
- **Cycle** : SKAO observing cycle associated with the proposal.
- **Proposal Title** : The title of the proposal.
- **PI** : Principal Investigator of the proposal. A proposal in 'draft' status without a PI indicated will have the |iconunaccept| as seen in :numref:`Figure %s <figure3>`.
- **Status** : Current status of the proposal (e.g., draft, submitted, Under Review, Accepted, Withdrawn, Rejected). 
- **Last Updated** : Date and time the proposal was last modified.
- **Allowed actions** (|ico4|) on each proposal. See  :numref:`Table %s <mytest>`.
