1. A list of Team Members (Left)

- Displays a table with information about each team member:

  - Last Name
  - First Name
  - Status: Indicates the invitation status of the member when an invitation of participation is sent (e.g., Pending, Accepted).
  - PhD Thesis check: The |icogood| icon is for a team member(s) who has indicated that part of the data resulting from the proposal will be used towards a PhD thesis.
  - Principal Investigator (PI) indicator: The |icopistar| icon indicates that the member is the PI of the proposal.
  - Actions (|icodelete|: Removes a team member from the proposal.)

  

2. Team Management Options (Right)

- **Invite Team Members**: Presents a form to invite team members to collaborate on the proposal as seen in :numref:`Figure %s <figure5>`. This section presents a form with the details below:
  
  - First Name : First Name of the team member.
  - Last Name : Last  Name of the team member.

  - Principal Investigator (PI) checkbox: Check to indicate that the member is the PI of the proposal.
  - for PhD Thesis checkbox: Check to indicate that part of the data resulting from the proposal will be used towards a PhD thesis.
  
  Once the required fields are filled the |icosend| button will become active and once clicked will populate the table on the left with the appropriate status.
