The Proposal Handling Tool (PHT) allows you to prepare and submit a proposal to the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO). The tool is guided so allows both seasoned and new astronomers to submit a scientific proposal.

The PHT supports both light and dark modes and can be accessed at the top left corner of the application through the |icostatus| icon.
