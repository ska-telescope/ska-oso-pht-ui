Introduction

Welcome, astronomers!

The Proposal Preparation Tool (PPT) allows you to prepare and submit a proposal to the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO). The tool is guided so allows both seasoned and new astronomers to submit a scientific proposal.

The PPT supports both light and dark modes and can be accessed at the top left corner |icostatus| of your screen - see :ref:`Figure 1 <figure1>`.

Common Elements Overview:
=========================
Common elements are recurring components found across multiple pages in the tool. They provide consistency and familiarity as they navigate through different sections. Below is an overview of the key common elements that you will encounter throughout the PPT.

Additionally, :ref:`Figure 2 <figure2>` provides three funtions which are navigation, status and validation of each page as outlined below.

- |icostatus2| represents a complete and validated page.
- |icostatus3| represents an incomplete page. 
- |icostatus4| represents a page that is not started and 
- |icostatus5| a page that has one or more failed field validations.

.. admonition:: Please note

   This is an MVP version of PPT, meaning it offers a subset of the functionalities planned for the future. However, it allows you to submit a proposal for a continuum observation.
