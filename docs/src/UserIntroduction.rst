Welcome, astronomers!

Do you wish to understand every detail there is to know about the mysteries of the universe? Do you wish to visit space in order to learn more about pulsars, black holes, and far-off galaxies? If so, the secret to unleashing the potential of the Square Kilometer Array Observatory and its telescopes lies in the Proposal Preparation Tool (PPT)!

What is PPT?
============

Consider a tool made especially for astronomers such as yourself. A tool that simplifies the proposal process and makes requesting observation and processing time on the state-of-the-art telescopes of the SKAO easier than before. That's exactly what PPT is! You can create strong proposals with it, and you'll be well on your way to making ground-breaking findings.

Who is it for?
==============

Both seasoned astronomers and those just starting out on their cosmic journey might benefit from PPT. We understand that putting in a proposal could be scary, but PPT has taken away the technological barriers so that astronomers can focus on what matters most: their scientific vision.

What can you achieve?
=====================

With PPT, you can:

- Submit proposals for scientific exploration: Let your curiosity guide you! Utilize the telescopes at the SKAO to view a wide range of cosmic objects and phenomena, including quasars, pulsars, and objects at the edge of the observable universe.
- Process and analyze public data: Delve into the wealth of data already collected by the SKAO. Uncover hidden insights and make new discoveries without requesting dedicated observing time.
- Secure observing time on the SKAO telescopes: Craft compelling proposals that highlight the scientific merit of your research. Gaining important observing time through successful proposals can lead to ground-breaking findings.
- Submit your research to journals: Contribute to the global dissemination of your study and the growth of astronomical knowledge.

Why choose PPT?
===============

- Easy to understand and intuitive: The user-friendliness of PPT is a priority in its design. All astronomers are guaranteed a seamless experience because of the simple interface and guided approach.
- Powerful capabilities: Don't be fooled by the simplicity. With all the capabilities you need to write thorough and powerful proposals, PPT is a powerful tool.
- Access to the state-of-the-art technology: Leverage the power of the world's most advanced radio astronomy facilities, the SKAO telescopes, to further our understanding of the universe.

Are you ready to embark on your celestial voyage?
=================================================

With the Proposal Preparation Tool, begin your cosmic exploration right now! You will be guided through every stage of the process by this user guide, from creating your proposal to submitting it. Now go ahead and let PPT serve as your springboard for celestial exploration as you let loose your scientific curiosity!

We hope you're excited to explore the universe with PPT!

.. admonition:: Please note

   This is an MVP version of PPT, meaning it offers a subset of the functionalities planned for the future. However, it still provides a powerful platform for astronomers to submit proposals and access valuable data.
