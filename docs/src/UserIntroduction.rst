Welcome, astronomers!

The Proposal Preparation Tool (PPT) allows you to prepare and submit a proposal to the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO). The tool is guided so allows both seasoned and new astronomers to submit a scientific proposal.

The PPT supports both light and dark modes and can be accessed at the top left corner of your screen - see *Figure 1*.
