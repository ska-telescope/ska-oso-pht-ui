SDP Data Page
~~~~~~~~~

The SDP (Science Data Processor) page is linked with the observation page so observation sets can be specified for which a data product is requested. Here, you can request a single or multiple sdp data products for an observation set or all observation sets added to your proposal.
:ref:`Figure <datapage>` shows the layout of the sdp data page in light mode when no data product has been added to observation set(s).
