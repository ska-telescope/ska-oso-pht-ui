Add Target
----------

The user can add a target by filling the form. 

Syntax check
--------------
The input fields of the form are checked for correct syntax, allowing only alpha-numeric characters and some limited special characters.

Errors messages are displayed under the inputs in case of incorrect syntax.

Form Validation
---------------

The form validation logic checks that there are no syntax issues and that input fields are completed as required.

No error message is displayed for empty fields, however the button will stay disabled.

Add Target Button
-----------------

The add target button is disabled by default, but is enabled if form validation is successful.

Once the button has been clicked, the targets table will be updated to include the new target.

The input fields are then cleared.
