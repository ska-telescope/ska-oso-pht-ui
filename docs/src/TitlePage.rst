Layout and Navigation
=====================

The Title Page has two main layouts:

Selecting Proposal Type
=======================

You will see several main proposal types like Standard Proposal, Key Science Project, and Director's Discretionary Time Proposal.
   
.. csv-table:: Proposal Types
   :header: "Proposal Type", "Initials", "Description"

    "Standard Proposal", "PI", "Standard Observing Proposal"
    "Key Science Project", "KSP", "A large science project that requires observing time allocations over a period longer than one cycle."
    "Director's Discretionary Time Proposal", "DDT", "Does not follow the normal proposal submission policies. It only requires approval from DG?"

Clicking a main proposal type reveals relevant sub-proposal types like Target of Opportunity or Joint SKA Proposal.

.. csv-table:: Sub-Proposal types
   :header: "Proposal Sub-Type", "Initials", "Description"

    "Target of Opportunity", "ToO", "A target of opportunity observing proposal"
    "Joint Telescope proposal", "JTP", " proposal that requires both SKA-Mid and SKA-Low telescopes"
    "Coordinated Proposal", "CP", "A proposal requiring observing to be coordinated with another facility( either ground or space based) with user-specified scheduling constraints provided."
    "Long Term Proposal", "LTP", "A proposal that spans multiple proposal cycles. This differs from KSP as LTP typically needs small amounts of time spread over more than one cycle and KSP requires a lot of observing time."
