- The title field accepts latex syntax - which can be previewed by clicking the "eye" icon next to the title field.
- Under proposal types you can select a :ref:`proposal category <proposaltypes>`. Once selected, click |icocreate| to create a proposal and proceed to the next page.

.. tip:: 
   On Hover:

   - Hovering over a proposal type displays a description for your reference.

.. csv-table:: Proposal Types
   :header: "Proposal Type", "Initials", "Description"

    "Principal Investigator (PI) project", "PI", "A PI project is an observing projects that require less time than a KSP, typically over a single Time Allocation cycle."
    "Key Science Project", "KSP", "Proposals  for  Key  Science  Projects  (KSP) will  be  for  relatively  large  resources  allocations  (time and compute) for observing programmes   that   cannot   be   completed   within   a   single   time   allocation cycle. Proposals for KSPs will be received and  reviewed  at  a  time  and  cadence  that  differs  from  the  regular  call for proposals."
    "Director General's Discretionary Time", "DDT", "DDT proposals (that could not reasonably have been submitted in the  normal  cycle)  can  be  submitted  at  any  time  needing  only  the  approval of the Director-General."


.. _subproposaltypes: 

.. csv-table:: Proposal Attributes
   :header: "Proposal SAtributes", "Initials", "Description"

    "Target of Opportunity", "ToO", "These are proposals that require rapid response to alerts that have been triggered by events either externally or internally to the SKA."
    "Joint SKA proposal", "JSP", "A proposal that requires both SKA1-LOWand SKA1-MIDtelescopes to achieve the science goals. Such proposals may be linked so that observations can be executed contemporaneously."
    "Coordinated Proposal", "CP", "A  proposal  requiring  observing  to  be  coordinated  with  another  facility    (either    ground- or   space-based)    with    user-specified scheduling constraints provided. The SKA Observatory will seek to establish  relationships  with  key,  complementary  facilities  (e.g.,  ALMA)  to  facilitate  CPs.  Proposals  for  VLBI  will be  considered  as  Coordinated Proposals."
    "Long Term Proposal", "LTP", "These are for projects that require more than one time allocation cycle  to  complete  (e.g.,  long-term  monitoring  campaigns)  but  are  too short in overall observing time to qualify as a KSP."
