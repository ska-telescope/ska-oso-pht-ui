As we embark on this path together, we want to be transparent about our development plans and invite your valuable feedback to shape the future of this tool.

Current State
=============

Right now, PPT is our MVP, offering essential functionalities to support your proposal creation:

- Manage your proposals: Create, view, and edit proposals in one centralized location.
- Define your targets: Specify individual targets.
- Outline observations: Detail your desired observation parameters for each target.

Near-Term Focus
