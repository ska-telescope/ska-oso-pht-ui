Current State
=============

Right now, PPT is our MVP, offering essential functionalities to support your proposal creation:

- Manage your proposals: Create, view, and edit proposals in one centralized location.
- Define your targets: Specify individual targets.
- Outline observations: Detail your desired observation parameters for each target.

Near-Term Focus
===============

Our most immediate need, is the Data Page. This crucial component will enable you to:

- Specify data you collect (e.g., beam size, polarization), desired product types (images, spectra), and processing needs.
- Utilize data calculators and access advanced options like simulations.
